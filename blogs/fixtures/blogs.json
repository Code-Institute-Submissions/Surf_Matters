You want to make sure you have all the details in place and, of course, you want to stick to a budget that isn't going to break the bank and keep you working for another three years before you can even think about taking another vacation. Your surf vacation is no different. The beautiful thing about your surf vacation is that your main goal is to be surfing good waves. That's it. This article will provide some helpful insight on making your next surf vacation a successful and enjoyable one. Follow these steps and you should cover all your bases.\r\n\r\n#### Step 1: Choose the right location and date of your Surf Vacation\r\n\r\nThe month/time of year of your vacation should play a big role in your choice of location. If you're a snow bunny, trying to get away from the cold weather, you want to choose a location where the waves are ideal during the months of December through February. Other surfers want to travel to locations during the slow season of their local break, which can be during the summer months. Regardless of when you plan your surf vacation, there are places throughout the world that offer surf tours, packages and vacations year round. Ideally, you want to select a place that has warm weather for most of the year and has the surf to fit your experience level.\r\n\r\n#### Step 2: Make sure your arrival and departure times work with the tour operator\r\n\r\nMany surf tours operate in remote locations of their respective countries. In many cases, this means a 1-2 hour drive from the airport to the surf camp/lodge. Be sure to schedule your arrival times in the morning. Your departure times should be in the late morning or early afternoon, which makes it easy for tour operators to schedule your transportation to and from the airport. If you arrive in the evening, you may need to book over night accommodations at a hotel/motel near the airport. If this is the case, you will be picked up the following morning. If members of your group are traveling on different flight itineraries, it's important that you schedule your flights so that you ALL arrive within an hour of each other. This is standard for most surf tours.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Choose a Surf Tour Operator that is ALL-INCLUSIVE\r\n\r\nThe last thing you want to be doing on your surf vacation is figuring out what you are going to eat after your daily surf session. Choose a Surf Camp that provides at least three meals a day and make sure the costs of the meals are included in the price that you pay for accommodations. This allows you to keep your wallet in the safe in the room, and you won't have to deal with carrying around cash unless you want to buy souvenirs or tip the staff members. This is a point that is often overlooked, but you'll find how much more enjoyable your surf vacation will be an ALL-INCLUSIVE surf camp, resort or lodge!\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Catch waves that are boat accessible\r\n\r\nThe best surf camps have boat access where you are able to get to secluded surf spots via boat. Hands down, this is the best way to surf, because you know you won't be surfing in crowded line ups. Although getting to your surf spot via truck isn't the worst thing in the world, you know you've chosen the right surf camp when your boat is anchored 50 yards from the line up and you're enjoying waves with no more than 8 other guys!\r\n\r\n#### Step 5: Double check your Documentation and Equipment\r\n\r\nIf traveling to a foreign country, make sure you have the right documentation. Most countries will require that your passport has at least 6 months left from the date of your departure to the expiration date. Some countries will also charge an entrance and exit fee. Be sure to look into these fees before you book your flights. If you plan on traveling with your own surf board, make sure the airline carrier does not have restrictions. Some airline carriers will have oversize restrictions for different destinations and during different times of the year. The better surf camps will have board rentals with at least 30 surf boards to choose from. Board Rental fees can be at a daily rate or weekly rate. Regardless of the cost, in many cases, this may be more convenient. Most Surf Vacations will also provide you with a packing list. Be sure to pay close attention to this list so you know exactly what to bring. You don't want to be sun burnt, because you forgot to pack your sun screen, and it isn't sold in that country.\r\n\r\n#### Step 6: Have Fun and plan your next trip\r\n\r\nWhether you plan your surf vacation with friends or family, make sure you have fun! Check to see if the tour operator offers discounts on repeat business. Chances are, if you had fun the first time, you'll have more fun the second or third time. If you can get a discount for being a repeat customer, all the better. Be sure to get some photos of your surf vacation and stay stoked!\r\n\r\nArticle Source: https://EzineArticles.com/expert/Jared_Keo/1222715", "date": "2021-01-30T10:23:18.028Z", "image_url": null, "image": "blog_image_1.jpg", "author": "Jared Keo"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Surfing Lessons -- Learn to Ride the Waves", "slug": "surfing_lessons", "opening": "Want to learn to surf but don't know where to start?

Surfing lessons are all about taking your surfing to the next level regardless of how much experience -- or lack thereof -- you may have. It's all about conquering fear, learning water safety, expanding your ocean and wave knowledge, and returning to the true essence of surfing -- fun and relaxation!\r\n\r\nYou're never too old to learn to surf. People of all ages are drawn to the majesty of our beautiful oceans. If you feel the call of the sun and surf pumping through your veins, it's time to find an instructor!\r\n\r\n#### Learning to Surf -- Finding an Instructor\r\n\r\nThe internet is a great place to find instructors and research their backgrounds and qualifications. Regardless of your reason for seeking out a surfing instructor there are a few things that you should consider mandatory: A long history of surfing (preferably professionally to some extent), up-to-date first aid certification, proven (preferably certified) surf rescue experience, and a thorough knowledge of wave, weather and wind conditions (which should be commensurate with the instructor's experience, i.e. The more time that they've been spent in the water, the greater their understanding of the ocean and weather conditions).\r\n\r\nThere are many excellent surfing instructors throughout the world. Many have been involved in competitive surfing of some description or have at least spent enough time in the water to have a sound knowledge of the demands of the sport.\r\n\r\nIf you're on holidays at the seaside and just want to experience surfing as a holiday activity then you shouldn't have too much trouble finding a local surfer or local surf school that can give you a quick rundown of the basics and give you a quick ride or two on a board. In some of the more renowned surfing spots you'll likely even be able to find a pro surfer to guide you to your first wave.\r\n\r\nIf you're a little more serious about your surfing, or want the complete surfing experience in the hands of a true professional, there are many professional/ex-professional surfers who can guide your development as a surfer and help you to get the most out of your surfing experience.\r\n\r\nSurfing greats such as Nancy Emerson, Corky Carroll and Frieda Zamba offer surfing lessons at some of the world's most beautiful beaches. Whether you're a beginner and very wet behind the ears, or a professional surfer in your own right, these experienced professionals can help you hone your skills and develop your style, giving you more confidence in the water and in your ability to navigate waves and the surf zone.\r\n\r\nDepending on how serious you are about the sport, you'll be able to choose from surfing lessons of a couple of hours at a time to surfing clinics and camps for more intensive training. You can learn to stand on a board and catch a small wave in a day, or work on form, style and ocean awareness with surfing legends over the space of several days to a week or more.\r\n\r\n#### Going It Alone?\r\n\r\nYou may be fired up and ready to surf, but don't jump the gun. It might be tempting -- especially in a beachside location or if you have friends that surf -- to just grab a surfboard and go for it.\r\n\r\nThis is a bad idea for two reasons: One, it's much easier to learn the right way to do things initially than to rectify bad habits and, two, you don't want to spend your hard earned money on surfing gear (and, in particular, on a surfboard) before you've had some training and experience, because you won't know what board best suits your style of surfing.\r\n\r\nMany surf schools will provide equipment for you to learn with. If you come across one that doesn't then it's usually possible to hire the necessary equipment from a surf shop. Have a couple of lessons first, maybe try a few different surfboards of various shapes and sizes (on hire from the surf shops), and then think a little more about what board is best for you. Your instructor should also be happy to give you some advice about where to start.\r\n\r\nAnother good reason to not go it alone initially is because surfing, like any sport, can be dangerous for the uninitiated. The awesome power of the ocean doesn't discriminate according to experience and even small breaks can have dangerous rips and currents. It's far safer at all times to only swim and surf in the company of fellow beach goers. That warning stands for both new and experienced surfers -- an unknown break is always potentially dangerous.\r\n\r\nAny surf instructor worth their salt will make sure that you only surf in conditions that are safe for your level of experience. Aside from the possibility that a serious spill might put you off surfing for good, big water surfing without the necessary experience is irresponsible at best, suicidal at worst -- never surf in conditions you aren't ready for, and only experiment under the watchful eye of a professional surfer or an experienced buddy!\r\n\r\nMost surfers will tell you that surfing is more than just a sport; it's an existential experience, the ultimate rush, and it can be addictive. So get yourself an instructor, suit up, grab a board and hit the beach!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Source: http://EzineArticles.com/208786", "date": "2021-01-31T20:21:26.336Z", "image_url": null, "image": "blog_image_2.jpg", "author": "Sarah Schell"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "How to Prevent Surfing Injuries With Surfing Workouts", "slug": "surf_workout", "opening": "Lots of touring surfers are often injured and many surfers in general suffer from back, shoulder and knee pain.

If this wasn't bad enough the new school surfing crew are pushing surfing dynamics that will only increase the likelihood of compression, rotational and impact injuries.\r\n\r\nNew school surfers are changing the elements of surfing that ultimately means surfers at all levels aspire to pull off big moves and launch themselves while twisting and turning their bodies like a gymnast or half pipe snowboard rider. These types of moves are far more challenging and stressful on the nervous system, joints, connective tissue and the human body. It will be the surfers who incorporate surfing workouts and specific surfing exercises into their lifestyles that will do much better when it comes to long-term surfing performance and competition.\r\n\r\nJordy Smith is over coming rib injuries, Jeremy Florence has to deal with ankle problems, Mick Fanning has over come torn muscles and scoliosis, Tom Carroll has had serious fin cuts. As more surfers are projecting themselves into critical sections of waves looking to land the ultimate aerial manoeuvre a higher number of surfing injuries will occur. If you wish to surf well it is wise to prepare for injuries because they happen to the best of the best.\r\n\r\nI believe the scene has gone full circle. Years ago every surfer was a cruiser, just happy to be in the water and flow. While this is still an important element of surfing today, the scene has dramatically changed. Back in the day surfers found pools and slopes to skate to maintain a sense of surfing and keep their bodies active during flat spells. This was their surfing exercise. Yet as the level of surfing became faster and more dynamic an elite few knew that surfing training was the best way to prevent injuries, surf better and surf for longer.\r\n\r\nShaun Thompson way back in the 70′s knew that surfers are athletes and as time has gone on surfers like Tom Carroll, Barton Lynch, Layne Beachley, Mick Fanning and Kelly Slater have proved that surfing, like golf, requires fitness, core strength, full body power, flexibility training and sport specific surfing workouts to overcome injuries and stay on top of their surfing performance. They knew that working on their bodies out of the water was key to performing better in the water. They knew that body weight training, connective tissue training, elements of yoga and elements of speed, agility and strength training all had a place in preparing the body for surfing.\r\n\r\nSurfing has slowly been recognized as a demanding sport rather than the outdated belief it is an easy non-physical past time. Surfers themselves are beginning to realize they must condition themselves like any other athlete. They are starting to understand there are important surfing training elements that can be trained out of the water that dramatically improve surfing performance and reduce the likelihood of athletic injuries.\r\n\r\nPut simply, surfing is a physically demanding sport that puts the rider into dangerous situations involving radical positioning and manoeuvres. The rotational torque on joints and muscles combined with bigger impacts landing on flat sections, boosting higher off meaty lips and racing with more speed through hollow sections means the entire body is constantly tested athletically. By incorporating surfing workouts into your life, a stronger, more flexible and fit body will be the result. Surfing workouts and specific surfing exercises ensure you will be able to consistently pull off dynamic manoeuvres without busting up your body or leaving you injured and watching from the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle Source: http://EzineArticles.com/6648988", "date": "2021-02-08T20:09:47.107Z", "image_url": null, "image": "blog_image_3.jpg", "author": "Hayden Rhodes"}}, {"model": "blogs.comment", "pk": 1, "fields": {"post": 1, "name": "Adam Parker", "email": "adamp@ap.com", "comment": "What a great article.
