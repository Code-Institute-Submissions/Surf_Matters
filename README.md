## **About**

Surf Matters is an e-commerce store, specialising in Surf Boards and Wetsuits and Surf Lessons.
The site was built with a friend in mind to showcase what an e-commerce store would look like for them as
they are looking to open a surf shop shortly.

Users are able to browse the products, sort by various categories and filter categories into certain products
and subcategory of products. A product details page enable users to view further information on individual products
and add them to their shopping bag to purchase.

There is also a blog page where users can browse submitted articles and leave comments, users are encouraged
to submit articles themselves via email.

Users are able to register for a new account, and once registered they can login and view their default delivery 
information and previous order history.

The deployed website can be viewed here -[Surf Matters](https://adamp-surf-matters.herokuapp.com/)
